## Preparation 1: 預測本頻道觀看人數 (上)-機器學習基本概念簡介

ML is about finding a function.

Besides **regression** and **classification** tasks, ML also focuses on **<u>Structured Learning</u>** -- create something with structure (image, document).

Three main ML tasks:

- Regression
- Classification
- Structured Learning

### Function with unknown parameters

*Guess* a function (**model**) $y=b+wx_1$ based on **domain knowledge**. $w$ and $b$ are unknown parameters. 

### Define Loss From Training Data

Loss is a function itself of parameters, written as $L(b,w)$​. 

An example loss function is:

$$ L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n} e_n $$
